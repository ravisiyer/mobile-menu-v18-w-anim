HTML, CSS and JS variation of menu part of [Dave Gray's Tailwind tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCxcTsOHrjo). The mobile menu button animation is based on [Brian Design's website tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FazgJVnrVuI).

This version provides a fully functional mobile menu, has a single menu for header (regular) and mobile, uses a list within nav element and has simple animation for mobile menu button.
